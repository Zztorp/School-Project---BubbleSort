# School-Project---BubbleSort

MY FIRST SORTING ALGORITHM!!

We were given the task of creating a sorting algorithm called Bubblesort. 
This is not the most efficient sorting algorithm but a very good school assignment to learn how these algorithms sometimes work.

Very exciting to develop a sorting algorithm!
